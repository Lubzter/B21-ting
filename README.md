I'd just like to interject for a moment. What you're referring to as Linux, is in fact, GNyU/Linux, or as I've recentwy taken to cawwling it, GNyU pwus Linyux. Linyux is nyot an opewating system unto itsewf, but whathew anyothew feee componyent of a fuwwy functionying GNyU system made usefuw by the GNyU cowewibs, sheww utiwities and vitaw system componyents compwising a fuwww OS as definyed by POSIX. Many computew usews wun a modified vewsion of the GNyU system evewy day, without weawizing it. Thwough a pecuwiaw tuwn of events, the vewsion of GNyU which is widewy used today is often cawwed "Linyux", basicawwy the GNyU system, devewoped by the GNyU Pwoject. Thewe weawwy is a Linyux, and these peopwe  awe using it, but it is just a pawt of the system they use. Linyux is the kewnyew: the pwogwam in the system that awwocates the machinye's wesources to the othew that you wun. The kewnyew is an usewess bynitsewf; it can onwy function in the context of a compwete opewating system. Linyux is the nyowmawwy used in the combinyation with the GNyU opewating system: the whowe system is basicawwy GNyU with Linyux added, ow GNyU/Linyux. aww the so-cawwed "Linyux"  distwibutions awe weawwy distwibutions of GNyU/Linyux.
